# TopicsExperiments

Scripts for calculating similarity between topics and building the topic similarity graph.

## Folders

* src
    * **name_subfolder**: description


## Files

For the most part of the scripts, the "main" function is located at the end of the file, i.e., after the methods and class definitions. It contains the inputs and outputs, as well as it calls the function that executes the task for the script.

# Examples

If you may find it useful to check some input and output files to understand how the scripts operate, you can check some of them by this [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LivGb9Nddbl2FByLqq6yPezBHxRzfBpT?usp=sharing).
